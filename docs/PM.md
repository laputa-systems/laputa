# Package Manager

`pm.xsh` is the typed Laputa package manager. It turns package recipes into a
deterministic `BuildPlan`, executes only that plan through immutable artifacts,
publishes verified snapshots, and composes runtime-only root generations.
Publication validates package identity before adding artifact and proof fields;
additional recipe metadata survives that augmentation unchanged.

## Package Contract

Recipes live at `repo/<package>/PKGBUILD.xsh` and export:

- `name: Str`, `ver: Str`, and positive `rel: Str`;
- `package_kind: "payload" | "meta"`;
- `deps`, `mkdeps_host`, and optional `mkdeps_target`;
- `upstream_sources` and `filetree`;
- `build(dest: Path)` for payload packages.

Payload recipes also carry `proof.xsh`. Metapackages declare no payload
`filetree`; they may contain dependencies only. `filetree` is the exact output
contract: each file or symlink is explicit, while a `tree` declaration covers
ordinary descendants. ELF outputs must be declared as `binary`.

Recipe loading is quarantined in `pm/recipe.xsh`. The rest of PM receives only
typed `Package` values; runtime lifecycle hooks are not part of the package
contract. Immutable root preflight rejects ownership conflicts before any
generation is written.

Recipe hooks take one `Path` and return `Result[Unit]`. `pm/recipe_hooks.xsh`
validates `build` and optional `prepare` against the existing declared capability
sets: `[fs, error]`, `[fs, env, error]`, `[process, env, error]`, or
`[fs, process, env, error]`. Optional `prepare_sources` uses `[fs, error]`.
Module validation compares declared effects exactly, so the boundary retains
each recipe's capabilities. A missing optional hook remains a no-op; a present
hook with incompatible parameters, result, export kind, or capabilities is
rejected before invocation.

`upstream_sources` selects `auto`, `archive`, `zip`, `cpio`, `file`,
`directory`, or `git` materialization. A `SKIP` checksum is accepted only for a
relative repository-local source. Source preparation is part of the package
build identity.

`repo plan` is the only resolution boundary. It records the target, typed
dependency graph, remote retrieval identity, build/proof inputs, executor
identity, action reasons, and sorted artifact keys in an atomically written
plan. `aarch64-linux-musl` remains the default build target.
`x86_64-linux-musl` can be planned and built on a native Linux x86_64 runner
with target-specific source checksums, filetrees, remote index entries, and
artifact keys. On other hosts, `repo build` rejects x86_64 before creating a
store. Artifact receipts can carry either
target and reject cross-target reuse of the same key. Root preflight and
composition preserve an explicit target and reject mixed receipts. Generation
plans and receipts also preserve x86_64 when supplied with verified x86_64
artifacts. The executor preserves x86_64 through recipe selection, build
metadata, proofs, receipts, and root composition.

`repo build` discovers the repository only by walking to a directory containing
both `pm.xsh` and `repo/`. It executes the saved plan with `pm/execute.xsh`;
artifact-store receipts are the sole resume state. `-j` changes scheduling only,
never a plan or artifact key.

`repo publish` selects the completed plan nodes from verified receipts, uploads
immutable payload, metadata, and proof objects, then updates the index last.
For network repositories it reads `LAPUTA_TOKEN` from the process environment;
PM does not store credentials. `file://` repositories need no token.

`root compose` selects only typed runtime edges from the saved plan and writes
an immutable generation receipt. It never installs into a live root. `root
inspect` and `store verify` are read-only receipt checks.
`store extract` copies one manifest-declared file from the exact artifact named
by a saved BuildPlan. `pm/generation_adapter.xsh::generation_adapter_copy_manifest_file`
checks the Store receipt and payload digest, verifies the file against artifact
metadata, and publishes the output by atomic rename. `PATH` must be canonical
and relative. Image builders use it for kernel files that are deliberately
absent from the runtime generation.
For a profile-owned overlay, `pm/generation.xsh::plan_profile` selects the
runtime closure and binds the overlay digest into its identity.
`write_generation_plan` and `read_generation_plan` persist and validate that
typed plan before `compose` uses it; the saved plan must match the BuildPlan and
overlay used for execution.

## Source Mirrors

Packages may keep source mirrors in a repository `.out/source-mirrors` cache.
`repo source-audit` verifies that cache for its explicitly named packages.
`source_mirror: false` keeps an input private to execution.

## Catalog and graph

`pm/catalog.xsh` is the repository-wide typed catalog boundary. It rejects
duplicate package names and malformed recipes before resolution.
`pm/policy.xsh` contains the explicit aarch64 bootstrap exceptions, while
`pm/graph.xsh` resolves stable runtime, build-host, and build-target edges.
The graph never adds an implicit package-manager dependency. Its sorted
topological levels and typed edge kinds are persisted in `BuildPlan`.
The native Docker adapter passes `XSH_PM_BOOTSTRAP_LLVM_ROOT=/usr/lib/llvm23`
for `gnu-stubs`: its LLVM edge is a bootstrap seed, so the recipe must use the
preseeded compiler while the replacement LLVM package is built.

`pm/make.xsh::check_tasks` and `run_tasks` accept `List[MakeTask]`, preserving
the task schema from compiler helpers through scheduling and spawned process
handles. `pkg_config_flags` preserves `PkgConfigFlags` string lists through
compiler and linker flag assembly. `MakeTask.argv` retains the existing heterogeneous argument boundary:
paths and strings are passed as individual process arguments rather than shell
source. Completed-task stamps are published only after the entire graph succeeds;
a failed command cancels unfinished peers.

## Identity, store, and snapshots

`pm/fingerprint.xsh` hashes canonical sorted input lines: recipe/package
inputs, proof input, PM tree, core tree, and runner bytes. The plan digest and
artifact/proof keys therefore exclude mtimes, absolute checkout paths, and
`.git` state. A proof-only change changes the proof identity without rebuilding
the payload.

`pm/store.xsh` accepts only validated keys. It locks a key, stages the payload,
verifies its inventory and proof, writes the receipt last, and atomically
renames the final directory. Corrupt final artifacts are rejected rather than
overwritten. `pm/repo.xsh` publishes only those verified plan receipts and
updates a file or remote snapshot index last.

## Root composition

`pm/root.xsh` preflights the exact artifact inventories and ownership before it
mutates a generation root. `pm/generation.xsh` chooses direct runtime roots and
the runtime closure only, then writes the deterministic receipt used by Laputa
to construct a disk image. Build tools do not leak into that closure unless a
separate typed runtime edge requires them.
Regular files and directories retain permission bits through `0o7777`,
including setuid helpers; symlink metadata remains fixed at `0o777`.

## Scope

PM builds aarch64 Linux-musl packages through the existing runner and x86_64
Linux-musl packages on a native Linux x86_64 runner. The shell-compatible
surface is limited to packages whose declared runtime capability requires it;
package construction itself uses typed XSH process and filesystem boundaries.

## Verification

PM behavior is covered by the focused modules under `tests/xsh/`:
`pm_recipe.xsh`, `pm_recipe_hooks.xsh`, `pm_graph.xsh`, `pm_graph_contracts.xsh`,
`pm_make.xsh`, `pm_plan.xsh`, `pm_store.xsh`,
`pm_root.xsh`, `pm_execute.xsh`, `pm_publish.xsh`, `pm_generation.xsh`, and
`pm_cli.xsh`.

The isolated `pm_graph_contracts.xsh` module covers nominal plan-action identity,
dependency-first ordering, selection boundaries, and cycle errors without
loading recipes or starting package builds. Run it against the checked-out
debug tools with `../xsh/target/debug/xsht test --jobs 1 tests/xsh/pm_graph_contracts.xsh`.
`pm_recipe_hooks.xsh` likewise exercises checked hook dispatch, absence, rejected
contracts, and cwd restoration with temporary fixtures. These host checks do not
validate the published runner pin or Linux package execution. `pm_make.xsh`
uses temporary native child scripts to verify argument and environment preservation,
dependency order, stamp reuse, failed-peer cancellation, and checked pkg-config
flag lists without package builds. `ca_certificates_recipe.xsh` checks the proof
metadata boundary using a temporary bundle and helper; `m4_recipe.xsh` checks
literal source operands and rejection of directory inputs. `parser_generators.xsh`
checks Bison token definitions, Flex definition expansion, generated output paths,
and missing-input diagnostics independently of Linux build modules.

Run a host-native suite with `make test-native XSH_ROOT=$HOME/d/laputa-systems/xsh`.
The Docker-backed suite is `make test`. The migrated enum declarations, explicit
environment overlays, collection APIs, and checked module contracts target the
checked-out XSH implementation. Update `XSH_RELEASE` and its binary hashes together
to a release containing those contracts before treating the published runner gate
as evidence for this checkout.
Use `make test-local-linux` to test the checked-out XSH ARM64 debug binaries in
the pinned Linux test image before updating the published release pin.
