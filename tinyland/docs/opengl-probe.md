# OpenGL feasibility probe (Phase 3)

Measured 2026-10-30/31, Linux x86_64. Guest-executed where stated;
otherwise host-executed against the exact packaged payloads with the
container musl toolchain (same binaries the PM proof runs).

## Current Mesa (after `opengl=true`, `packages/mesa/PKGBUILD.xsh` rel 2)

- Options: `platforms=wayland`, `gallium-drivers=softpipe,virgl`,
  `egl/gbm/gles2` plus desktop `opengl` on, `llvm=disabled`,
  `glx=disabled`. No libGL is shipped (no GLX without X11); desktop GL
  is EGL-only, which is all Ghostty links.
- Generated sources regenerated for the new option set per
  `packages/mesa/files/generated/README.md` (81 outputs, archive
  `9938c1ac…`): the `opengl=false` set (70 outputs) lacked 11 desktop
  GL tables (`glapi_gentable.c`, `glapi_mapi_tmp.h`, `indirect*.c/h`,
  `g_egldispatchstubs.c/h`, `egl.def`, `gles2.def`).
- Proof (host-executed proof root, surfaceless EGL; same cases as the PM
  proof, replicated manually against payloads `a1a11de8…` + musl +
  libdrm + wayland-libs-client): `GL_RENDERER=softpipe`,
  `GL_VERSION=OpenGL ES 3.1 Mesa 26.2.4` (unchanged), and:
  `DESKTOP_GL_RENDERER=softpipe`,
  `DESKTOP_GL_VERSION=3.3 (Compatibility Profile) Mesa 26.2.4`,
  with a green 8x8 FBO clear + readback (`desktop-rendered`).
  Command: container-musl `cc` build of the proof program, run under
  the packaged `ld-musl` with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` + `GBM_BACKENDS_PATH`.
- Payload 4.28M → 5.14M (+0.86MB). `DT_NEEDED` unchanged apart from
  the desktop driver: no `libLLVM`, no new runtime deps
  (libm/libdrm/libwayland-client/libgbm/libgallium only).

## Ghostty renderer requirement (packaged binary)

- `ghostty-custom-1.4.1-1`: `app runtime: .wayland`,
  `renderer: renderer.generic.Renderer(renderer.OpenGL)`; its source
  (`src/renderer/OpenGL.zig`) requests an EGL 4.3 core profile context
  (`MIN_VERSION_MAJOR=4`, `MIN_VERSION_MINOR=3`,
  `EGL_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE_BIT`) and fails closed with `OpenGLOutdated`
  below 4.3.

## QEMU display (guest 3D path)

- Profiles with `qemu_gpu: Virgl` launch `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` with
  `-display egl-headless` in test mode (`system/qemu.xsh`). The host
  QEMU needs Alpine's optional virgl and EGL display modules
  (`docs/QEMU.md`); without them only `virtio-gpu-pci` and
  `-display none` exist, which is what the first probe saw.
- Guest-executed (2026-10-30, Linux x86_64 host with an AMD radeonsi
  GPU): the exact-attribs reproducer below, run in a guest on
  `virtio-gpu-gl-pci`, printed
  `renderer=virgl (... (radeonsi, ...)) version=4.3 (Core Profile) Mesa 26.2.4`
  for Ghostty's attribs, and `4.3 (Compatibility Profile)` for the
  attrib-less maximum.

## Ghostty presentation path (guest Wayland trace)

`WAYLAND_DEBUG=client` on the packaged Ghostty in `qemu-tinyland-ghostty`
shows it binds `wl_compositor`, `wl_shm`, `wl_seat`, and `xdg_wm_base`,
never `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1`. It renders through EGL off screen (its log
reads `info(opengl): loaded OpenGL 4.3`), reads the frame back into one
1280x800 `wl_shm` buffer, and attaches that buffer each frame. Tinyland
therefore needs no dmabuf support for Ghostty, and the GL ceiling is set
only by the driver behind the render node.

## Keyboard blocker (Ghostty Custom)

The packaged Ghostty receives no keys. In its source at the pinned commit
`354a4e3`, `src/apprt/wayland/connection.zig` binds `wl_seat` inside the
registry roundtrip, and the second roundtrip dispatches the seat's
`capabilities` event. The seat listener is attached only later, in
`src/apprt/wayland/App.zig` (`Seat.init`), so libwayland discards the
event (`discarded wl_seat#6.capabilities(2)` in the trace), `getKeyboard`
is never called, and no `wl_keyboard` exists. Compositors send seat
capabilities once at bind, so this reproduces on any compositor. The fix
belongs in Ghostty Custom: attach the seat listener at bind, or create the
seat before the second roundtrip. In the same function,
`registry.setListener(*Connection, onRegistryEvent, &self)` stores a
pointer to a stack local that `connect` then returns by value, so any
later registry event writes through a dangling pointer.

## Verdict

Softpipe desktop ceiling is **3.3 compat** (measured above), below
Ghostty's required **4.3 core**. virgl on a GPU host provides **4.3
core** (guest-measured above), and `qemu-tinyland-ghostty` renders
Ghostty on it. llvmpipe remains the 4.3-capable path for hosts without
virgl and needs LLVM.

Exact-attribs reproducer (packaged `mesa-26.2.4-2` payloads + musl,
container-musl `cc`, run under the packaged `ld-musl`): requesting
precisely Ghostty's context attribs (4.3, core profile, surfaceless)
fails with `GHOSTTY_ATTRIBS_FAILED error=0x3009` (`EGL_BAD_MATCH`),
exit 3. Ghostty's source requests these attribs and fails closed with
`OpenGLOutdated` below 4.3, so the packaged renderer init cannot
succeed on this stack. Reproduce without the PM: extract the mesa,
musl, libdrm, wayland-libs-client, expat, and libffi payloads into
`eglroot/`, compile the program below with the container musl `cc`
against it, and run it under `eglroot/usr/lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1`
with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`GBM_BACKENDS_PATH` pointed at `eglroot`:

```c
#include <EGL/egl.h>
#include <EGL/eglext.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    PFNEGLGETPLATFORMDISPLAYEXTPROC get =
        (PFNEGLGETPLATFORMDISPLAYEXTPROC)eglGetProcAddress("eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT");
    if (!get) { printf("NO_GET_PLATFORM_DISPLAY\n"); return 1; }
    EGLDisplay dpy = get(EGL_PLATFORM_SURFACELESS_MESA, EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY, NULL);
    EGLint major = 0, minor = 0;
    if (dpy == EGL_NO_DISPLAY || !eglInitialize(dpy, &major, &minor)) {
        printf("NO_EGL_DISPLAY 0x%x\n", eglGetError()); return 2;
    }
    eglBindAPI(EGL_OPENGL_API);
    /* Exactly what Ghostty requests (src/renderer/OpenGL.zig). */
    static const EGLint ghostty_attribs[] = {
        EGL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION, 4,
        EGL_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION, 3,
        EGL_CONTEXT_OPENGL_PROFILE_MASK, EGL_CONTEXT_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE_BIT,
        EGL_NONE,
    };
    EGLContext ctx = eglCreateContext(dpy, EGL_NO_CONFIG_KHR, EGL_NO_CONTEXT, ghostty_attribs);
    if (ctx == EGL_NO_CONTEXT) {
        printf("GHOSTTY_ATTRIBS_FAILED error=0x%x\n", eglGetError());
        return 3;
    }
    printf("GHOSTTY_ATTRIBS_OK (unexpected on softpipe)\n");
    return 0;
}
```

The null-attrib max-version probe in the mesa proof is the standing
ceiling check.

## Decision (recorded with numbers; no LLVM committed)

- Preferred remains virgl where a host supports it (no guest LLVM,
  no `libLLVM` in the kiosk closure, which current profiles forbid via
  `forbidden_sonames`). Selected for `qemu-tinyland-ghostty` once the
  host QEMU virgl modules were installed; it measured 4.3 core in the
  guest.
- llvmpipe fallback cost, measured: the `llvm-toolchain` payload
  (145.8M) ships `libLTO`/`libclang` only — no `libLLVM.so`. A shared
  `libLLVM` (~100MB class, against the 3.0M tinyland / 5.1M mesa
  scale) would need a recipe change plus a new runtime package, Mesa
  `-Dllvm=enabled` plus another generated-sources regeneration, the
  `libLLVM` profile-ban lift on ghostty profiles only, and a full
  guest re-proof. Estimated guest growth: tens of MB (order of the
  whole current kiosk image). Not committed in this slice.
- Landed instead: EGL-only desktop GL (3.3, functional, +0.86MB, no
  new deps) with the ceiling machine-checked by the mesa proof, so a
  future driver change that moves the ceiling re-opens this decision
  loudly rather than silently.
